I just started a Learning Group, and Iâ€™d love to have you as a member. You are hereby invited to join the new.

A Lean In group is a small group of technicians who meet to support each other and learn new skills. Our **"Full Stack Java Developer Community"** will be a place where we can be unapologetically ambitious, expand our networks, and help each other achieve our goals.

Weâ€™ll dive into a different topic like Core Java, JSP, Servlets, Spring, SpringBoot, SQL, Hibernate, Junit, Mockito, SQL, Spring MVC, Kafka, PCF, Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, ranging from identifying our strengths to combating bias at work. Lean In has teamed up with leading experts to create and activities that will guide our discussions.

I think youâ€™d be a wonderful addition to the group and hope youâ€™ll consider joining us.
